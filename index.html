      For those aspiring to grow a career in any sector, having a LinkedIn account and a robust network is immensely helpful. I believe every computer science student should have a LinkedIn account. Many of you already do, and this initiative is aimed at helping us connect and expand our networks on LinkedIn. Have a nice day, and letâ€™s connect on LinkedIn!
